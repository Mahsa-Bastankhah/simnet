# Simnet

Simnet is a tool to simulate a decentralized application using the cloud to
host the simulation nodes. It provides multiple configurations to affect the
topology so that specific link between two nodes can have a delay or a loss
of packets.

## Engines

The simulation uses engines to manage the deployment and running of the rounds.
A kubernetes engine is provided and used by default.
